Given the base (in units) of a right-angled isoceles traingle, find the maximum number of 2X2 squares that can fit in the triangle with given base.

Example 1:

Input: 8
Output: 6

Example 2:

Input : 7
Output : 3
Explanation : In the base we can keep 2 squares
and above the two squares we can only keep 1 square.  
So the total number of squares are equal to 3.
